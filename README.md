# DEV-IN-BASIC
Hardware files for PowerFilm's implementation of the BQ25570

The Indoor Solar Development Kit (DEV-IN-BASIC) makes integrating indoor solar into electronics simple. It consists of an energy harvesting module with integrated power management designed and optimized for Indoor Light Series solar panels.

The DEV-IN-BASIC kit uses a nano-power boost charging technology to efficiently extract energy from the indoor solar, even in dimly lit environments down to 200 lux and below. The integrated power management can be configured to store the collected energy into various storage element technologies. An output power rail is used to provide power to external electronics.
